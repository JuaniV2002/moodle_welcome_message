# Moodle Welcome Message Plugin
This plugin will send a customizable welcome message to users upon enrollment. This message will be sent to:

- The user's email (can be changed in the preferences menu on the profile page)
- A web notification, the little bell on the header will display a (1).
- If the user has downloaded the Moodle App, a push notification will arrive too.

For the plugin to work at its best, it is better to disable the default welcome message Moodle sends to users (I find it a it bland). To do that as an admin:

Site administration > General > Messaging > Notification settings > look for "Welcome message for new course enrolments" > turn off that switch.

The plugin also has a settings page under the local section so that the message header and body can be changed. Variables can be used to make the message more personal.
